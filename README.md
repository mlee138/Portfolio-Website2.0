# Portfolio-Website

- This project aims to display myself as a person and my current abilities in web development.
- The website allows the user to learn about myself, see my portfolio, check my resume, and contact me through email.
- The project uses several languages includes HTML, CSS, PHP, Javascript, and JQuery. All pictures were taken by me.

Note: This project is still in progress and will continually grow as I learn more!

Future updates: Implement increased responsiveness for mobile users
